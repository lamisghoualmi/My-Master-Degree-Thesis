## Abstract
Population based optimization algorithms are powerful algorithms that can solve several types
of problems in different domains. They are often recommended in medical imaging domain. Among
population based meta-heuristics we find particles swarm optimization (PSO), which is one of the
best optimization algorithms. It is simple to understand, to use and to implement. However, as other
optimization algorithms, PSO has a big desadvantage. The problem of premature convergence is
one of the major problems.

To overcome this limitation we use in our project a new variant of the PSO algorithm which
is the quantum PSO (QPSO) to solve the segmentation in medical imaging by using the thresholding,
This variant is based on quantum mechanics rather than the Newtonian rules assumed in all
previous versions of PSO. The QPSO algorithm is much more efficient than conventional PSO,
but it is proved that this algorithm also suffers from the problem of premature convergence. To
overcome this limitation and improve the performance of the QPSO algorithm, we proposed a second
variant named OQPSO algoithm which introduces the concept of opposition-based learning
(OBL) in the QPSO. The results showed that this new variant is more efficient than the basic QPSO.

In order to validate our contribution, a set of tests was carried out to segment medical images
by using thresholding whith two objective functions the first is called Kapur entropy and the second
one is called the inter-class variance of Otsu. The results showed that the OQPSO algorithm
outperformed the basic QPSO as well as the ABC and the GABC which were also implemented in
order to carry out a comparative study.
